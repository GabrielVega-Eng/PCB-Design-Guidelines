# PCB Design Guidelines

By the knowledge of those more experience then me and by the experience of many mistakes (or happy little accidents as Bob Ross would say) I've compiled a list of useful information to help anyone who works with PCB design.

 If this list has been useful in any way for you, I'm happy to be of service.
 
 ## Introduction

For any hardware project to as successful as it can be, it relays on three aspects:

- Clear definition of the requirements and objectives.
- Applying the best technics for schematic and layout together with good references and datasheets.
- Good documentation of the whole design process.

(Create Venn diagram of those three aspects)

For the first aspect, one must first create a list of the requirements for that project, what is the bare minimum in terms of performance for that project to have.

 Ask yourself: what kind of results do I want to achieve? What resources (tools, knowledge, materials) I have available? What references or proven concepts I have to use as a starting point?

Second aspect is to use the best technics and practices for the schematic and layout. This comes from practice and experience. But one thing that can help you improve is the use of good reference material. May that be other projects or simply reading the datasheet of component. Good datasheets usually have an application note/guideline for that specific component. Follow the datasheet and that will give you a good starting point.
