# PCB Design Guidelines

By the knowledge of those more experience then me and by the experience of many mistakes (or happy little accidents as Bob Ross would say) I've compiled a list of useful information to help anyone who works with PCB design.

 If this list has been useful in any way for you, I'm happy to be of service.
 
 ## Introduction

For any hardware project to as successful as it can be, it relays on three aspects:

- Clear definition of the concepts and requirements for that project.
- Applying the best technics for schematic and layout together with good references and datasheets.
- Good documentation of the whole design process.

For the first aspect, one must first create a **list of the requirements** for that project, what is the bare minimum in terms of performance for that project to have.

Ask yourself: what kind of results do I want to achieve? What resources (tools, knowledge, materials) I have available? What references or proven concepts I have to use as a starting point?

Second aspect is to use the **best technics and practices** for the schematic and layout. This comes from **practice** and **experience**. 

But one thing that can help you improve is the use of good reference material. That could be other projects or simply reading the datasheet of component that you are using. Good datasheets usually have an application notes/guidelines for that specific component. Follow the datasheet and that will give you a good starting point.

The third aspect is the **art of documentation**. This is what defines and differentiate engineering from the backyard thinkering. Creating good documentation helps everyone in all aspects and moments of the project. The R&D team can create a solid information and overall product with those documents and the maintenance team can have the support needed for their job.
